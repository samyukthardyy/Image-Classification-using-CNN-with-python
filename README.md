This project is done using Google collab code editor.
In this project the image classification is employed using CNN(Convolutional Neural Network) with Data Augmentation.
This project is done using Python Programming Language.
I used Fashion MNIST Dataset for training the model.
Project acheived good testing accuracy with both ANN and CNN.
